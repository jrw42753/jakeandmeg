            <p>A friendship blossomed into more when Meg and Jake were co-leaders of Creighton University's Program Board - the student government's event planning organization. Jake confessed his feelings and asked Meg out on a date at the end of what was his Sophomore year and Meg's Junior year. This happened to be mere days before Meg was scheduled to leave on a mission driven study abroad program to Peru, therefore she rejected Jake. After a dose of persistence and waiting 2 months for Meg to return, Jake and Meg were able to flirt and kindle a rommance.</p>
            <p>It wasn't until a year later, after Jake came back from a semester abroad in Australia that the couple made their relationship official. Since then, they have adopted a puppy named Ozzie together, moved to Denver, Colorado together, and have loved going on trips together.</p>
